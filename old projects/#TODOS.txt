Analysis - Bottom Up
--------------------
Calculate the assets Relative Performance in terms of ...
    1. Relative Momentum (Sector, Industry, SubIndustry)
    2. Sharpe
    3. Treynor (Sector, Industry, SubIndustry)
    4. Alpha (Sector, Industry, SubIndustry)
    5. Beta (Sector, Industry, SubIndustry)
    6. Standard deviation / Semi Standard deviation / Yang Zhang

Create sort of machine learning pipeline for manipulating and tranforming features your data

Create a factor analysis methods for evaluateing predictability of stocks

Find a reliable multivriate time series machine learning model you can use to train / test

Evaluate the results of and Convergence of the models parameters to predict the output so you can tune it





Analysis - Top Down
-------------------
Pull data for all 500 Consituents in the S&P 500

Evaluate the Highest Sharpe vs lowest Sharpe

Evaluate Highest Beta vs lowest Beta

Calculate Relative Performance for each major markete and

Import VIX term data from the CBOE

Evalulate capital markets indicators that can be useful for estimating ERP

Create An index using a form of PCA for each industry / Sector not based on market cap





Analysis - Portfolio
--------------
Create individual pie charts that show the consitutient Industries for each Sector
Calculate the rolling historical average internal correlation.
Find the assets that have the smallest(more important) / Highest average Internal correlation to your portfolio

Create indicies composed of similar sectors and asset groups, and create a pairwise plot to evaluate 
distribution characteristics

Do seperate rankings for correlation

have an existential crisis about using percent returns instead of absolute prices for correlations and other statistics

Analyze your short term positions and create a system to hedge gamma for these portfolios using pairs trades 

Begin to implement greek portfolio managment for implementing delta , gamma, and vega neutral strategies

Compute Greek ratios for your portfolio

Obviously Gamma will always be to much, so find a greek ratio that better represents what quanity of gamma is tolerable for the risk/reward

Give the highest level overview of your greeks and underlying risk profile at the top of your notebook

Automate Portfolio objective overview

Use a form of graph theory to dynamically allocate captial to the most efficeint componetns wihtin a criteria (Industry, Beta, Asset class,etc..) using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYAdKuV281k

Calculate and visualize the delta offsett of the distribution of your portfolio

Evaluate the Skew and Kurtosis of your portfolio compared with the benchmark(S&P500)

for some reason, BRK/B is not processed correctly when loading portfolio, fix it

 potential for an asset with its consitutients
